Task 1 [Marks: 40]
- Identify a list of 30 dictionary words commonly used to create passwords. Submit this list in a
doc file.
- Users often create passwords using a variation of dictionary words, which include but are not
limited to the following strategies:
● Password based on repeating a dictionary word twice or thrice (e.g., catcat, dogdogdog).
● Password based on a dictionary word spelled backwards (e.g., sttesuhcassam).
● Password based on quick adjustments, like making the first letter of a word capital,
adding a digit as the second last or last character, and/or adding a common special
character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, &) at the end.
● Password based on replacing letters in a dictionary word with similar-looking numbers or
special characters, like replacing ‘a’ by ‘@’, ‘i’ by ‘!’, ‘S’ by ‘$’, ‘S’ by ‘5’, etc. [Find more of
such possible replacements, and make a list of the replacements you have considered in
your program. Submit this list in a doc file].
● Password based on combining any of the above techniques, like ‘T@ctac1%’ [cat ->
catcat -> tactac -> Tactac -> Tactac2 -> Tactac2% -> T@ctac2%]
Write a computer program with the following input and outputs:
Input: The dictionary word
Output: A list of common passwords, which could be created by using different variations of
that dictionary word. Such variations should include at least the above-noted techniques
commonly used by people in creating passwords.
- Use this program to enhance your list of common dictionary words, by adding their variations
to that list. You can call it Enhanced List of Common Passwords 1.0 (ELCP 1.0).

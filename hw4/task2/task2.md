Task 2 [Marks: 40]
Assume that a user needs to provide the following personal information during creating his/her
online account with your organization (before password creation for that account):
i-a) First Name
i-b) Last Name
ii) Date of Birth (Format: MM/DD/YYYY)
iii) Telephone Number (Format: xxx-xxx-xxxx)
iv) Mailing Address
Format:
Street Information (Street number and name): ______, APT No. (if applicable): ______
City: __________ , State: __________, Zip Code (first 5-digit): ______________
v) Email ID (it will be also used as a “User ID” for the account).
Users often create password based on their personal information, which include but are not
limited to the following:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Date of Birth (DOB)
- A part of DOB, like the year of birth (1992 or just 92)
- Telephone Number
- A part of Telephone Number, like the first 6 digits or last 4 digits
- Street Number from Mailing Address
- Street Name from Mailing Address
- Apartment Number from Mailing Address
- Name of City from Mailing Address
- Name of State from Mailing Address
- Zip Code from Mailing Address
- Part of Email ID created by user, like for person@gmail.com: “person” could be a part of
password; for person_gemini@gmail.com: “person” and/or “gemini” could be a part of
the password.
Sometimes, users use a different variations of the above personal information to create their
password, which include but are not limited to the following: Password based on replacing
letters in a word with similar-looking numbers or special characters, like replacing ‘a’ by ‘@’, ‘i’
by ‘!’, ‘S’ by ‘$’, ‘S’ by ‘5’, etc. [Find more of such possible replacements, and make a list of the
replacements you have considered in your program. Submit this list in a doc file. To be clear,
you will need to submit just one such list for Task 1 and Task 2].
Write a computer program with the following input and outputs:
Input: User’s Personal Information (needed to provide for creating an online account with your
organization: see above)
Output: A list of common passwords for that user, which could be created by using different
variations of that information. Such variations should include at least the above-noted
techniques commonly used by people in creating passwords.
- Use this program to enhance your list of possible passwords based on a user’s personal
information, by adding their variations to that list. You can call it Enhanced List of Common
Passwords 2.0 (ELCP 2.0)
